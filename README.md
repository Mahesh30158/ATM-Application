topic "ATM Applications"using C language.

Objective:

This project is a console-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) application developed to simulate basic banking operations.

The application allows users to create accounts, check balances, deposit and withdraw money, and change PINs securely.

It includes user authentication and input validation to ensure safe and smooth transactions.

This project is ideal for demonstrating core programming concepts like file handling, control structures, data storage, and user interface via console.

Works:

The user is prompted to insert (simulate) their card and enter a valid PIN.

Upon successful login, a menu is displayed with options like balance check, withdrawal, deposit, and PIN change.

All data (like user details and transaction history) is securely stored and retrieved using file or database systems.

After every transaction, the system updates the account records and logs out the user.

Operations:

1.User Login (PIN verification)

2.Check Balance

3.Deposit Amount

4.Withdraw Amount

5.Change PIN

6.Logout / Exit
